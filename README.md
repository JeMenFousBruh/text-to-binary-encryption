# Text to Binary Encryption Tool

This is a simple, hacker-themed web tool that converts plaintext into encrypted binary using a customizable key. The tool takes input text and a key (number of bits), then applies a binary encryption algorithm with random salt values, allowing for secure and dynamic encryption. The encrypted binary output is formatted to have a 133-bit breakpoint and can be easily copied for use in other applications.

## Features

- **Text Encryption**: Converts your plaintext into binary based on a custom key (number of bits).
- **Salt-Based Encryption**: Introduces a random salt between 3 and 9 to increase security.
- **Formatted Output**: The binary output is formatted with a 133-bit line break for readability.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Easily copy the encrypted binary to the clipboard for further use.
- **Responsive Design**: The input and output areas are scrollable, ensuring usability even with large texts.

## How to Use

1. **Enter Text**: Type your message in the `Enter text` box.
2. **Set the Key**: Provide a number of bits for encryption (e.g., 7, 8, etc.).
3. **Encrypt**: Click the `Encrypt` button to generate the binary representation of your text.
4. **Copy Binary**: Click the `Copy` button to copy the generated binary output to your clipboard.
